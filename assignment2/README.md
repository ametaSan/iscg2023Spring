Please open cmd and run % .\VC\x64\Release\loopsub.exe bunnynh_sub500.obj

or, run % .\VC\x64\Release\loopsub.exe spot_quadrangulated.obj

The bunny is of triangles and the ox quads (with a few triangles, however).



This assignment assumes that all input models are with quads for CC and DS, and triangles for LOOP, for simplicity.

The codes programed by myself is highlighted by "student codes".

Codes highlighted are mainly 6 functions in LoopSub.hxx: 

- setSplit_loop();

- setSplit_CC();

- setSplit_DS();

- setStencil_loop()

- setSplit_CC();

- setSplit_DS();
